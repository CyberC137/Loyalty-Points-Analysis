# 🧮 Loyalty Points Analysis – Analytics Case Study

This repository contains a full project for analyzing loyalty points as part of a business case study. It simulates transaction and gameplay data for a fictional gaming platform and demonstrates how to:

- Compute player loyalty points using deposits, withdrawals, and games played
- Analyze slot-based activity on specific dates
- Rank players based on activity
- Allocate bonus rewards fairly
- Critique and improve the loyalty scoring formula
